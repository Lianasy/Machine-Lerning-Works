# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of applied Machine Learning projects developed as part of a Computer Science programme. Each notebook demonstrates a practical implementation of core ML concepts, focusing on model design, evaluation, and interpretation.

Projects
1. Supervised Learning — Regression and Classification (lab1_ml.ipynb)
Introduction to fundamental supervised learning techniques and model evaluation.
Key topics:
Linear and polynomial regression
Logistic regression and decision boundaries
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Model evaluation using cross-validation and performance metrics

2. Ensemble Methods and Model Optimisation (lab2_ml.ipynb)
Exploration of advanced supervised techniques using ensemble methods.
Key topics:
Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging
Hyperparameter tuning and grid search
Overfitting control and regularisation techniques
Comparative analysis of model performance

3. Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction (lab3ml.ipynb)
A study of clustering and data representation techniques in unsupervised learning.
Key topics:
k-Means and hierarchical clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE
Data visualisation and feature interpretation
Evaluation of clustering quality and separation

Technologies
Python 3.10
scikit-learn
NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Objective
These projects focus on understanding and applying the core principles of machine learning — from classical algorithms to model interpretation. Each notebook functions as an independent research experiment, combining theoretical insights with practical implementation.
